# Project Alpha — Autonomous Reconnaissance Rover
Sep 2023 – Jul 2024

## Overview
**Awarded: Gold CREST Award (Engineering Education Scheme)**

Project Alpha is an autonomous reconnaissance rover developed as part of the Engineering Education Scheme (EES) and awarded the Gold CREST Award. The system combines a manually driven rover platform with an AI-powered sentry turret, capable of real-time object detection and tracking using TensorFlow Lite and OpenCV running on a Raspberry Pi. The turret uses stepper motors for pan/tilt actuation and a USB webcam for live vision input.

In a multidisciplinary team of 7 engineers, computer scientists and physicists, we built a reconnaissance rover with a camera 'sentry' turret: the rover platform was manually controlled, while the turret performed real-time object detection and basic target tracking using TensorFlow Lite + OpenCV on a Raspberry Pi.

## Features
- Real-time object detection (TensorFlow Lite Task Library)
- Webcam and Pi camera capture (OpenCV)
- Optional pan/tilt tracking interface (GPIO stepper control stubbed + mock driver)

## Our Project Goals
- Reduce human risk in dangerous environments by enabling remote reconnaissance.
- Perform on-device AI inference on low-power hardware.
- Track detected objects using a motorised pan/tilt turret.
- Design and deliver a complex system using formal engineering planning (Gantt charts, milestones, modular design).
- Formally document this process in a professionally written technical portfolio and report.
